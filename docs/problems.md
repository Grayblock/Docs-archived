# What are we trying to solve?
Grayblock Power is a decentralized finance application that allows Energy Developers to source loans for individual energy projects. Energy development is a capital intensive activity, for which banking services are critical. Due to both the volume and size of energy projects looking to be developed, many independent or mid-sized energy developers can not get loans for their energy projects and even if successful can take up to 3 - 6 months time.

# Who is the product for? 

The product is to connect energy developers and the individuals who are interested in investing in energy projects by financing these projects.  Each project would issue a project token (PT(x) token) which represent the partial ownership in the investment project. 

PT(X) tokens are limited in supply and specific to the pools. PT(X) tokens may be increased for a specific developer if they want to finance more of the same/similar project. For example, the Project Developer may want to list more of the same Vietnam project but increase by 5 MWs. Therefore, the Project developer must be able to sell 5000 more PT1 tokens that is purchasable at $10 USDC per 1 PT1 token. 

We are allowing energy developers to list projects which have undergone a threshold level of due diligence for the public crypto market to purchase. This not only enables energy developers around the world to accelerate their build-out of energy projects, but it also provides the crypto market a stable, energy backed payment that is high yield relative to conventional finance instruments (ie green bonds or high-interest savings accounts).

It is estimated for the world to achieve its Net-Zero targets, it must deploy 1.5 - 2.5 Trillion USD in annual investment over the next 3 decades. Banks and governments do not have the bandwidth nor market mechanisms available to deploy this capital in a fair and economic manner. In addition, in many countries for which there is no credit ratings available, mid-sized projects of 50 MWs (50 million in the capital) simply will never receive financing. The opportunity is for this system to capture a trillion dollar market where 1,000s MWs need to be developed around the world in a quick manner.
